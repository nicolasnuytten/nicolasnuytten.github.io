        <h3 class="detail-title">Brief</h3>
        <p class="detail-text"> We had to make an endless game in Phaser framework using Webpack in 5 weeks in teams of two. The game has the requirements to have a scoring system (AJAX & PHP) & leaderboards. We had to work togheter by using Github.</p>
        <h3 class="detail-title">Deadlines</h3>
        <p class="detail-text">We had some deadlines on the project. In the first week we had to pitch our idea to the teachers from then we had to
        give them status update every week on. In the 3rd week we had to switch from projects between teams and work further on
        the code they wrote, we also had to present our progress we had made for a intermediate evaluation. In the last week we
        had to do a final presentation and explain what we worked on the other teams project.</p>

        <h3 class="detail-title">Teamwork</h3>
        <p class="detail-text">Myself and Jens Van Steen worked on this project for the first 3 weeks. We were so proud on the
          result we
          made we want to finish the game in our free time. I have to say working togheter with Jens was great. The
          communication
          was right, planned the tasks we had to do and talk about the problems we had and find a solution.</p>
        <h3 class="detail-title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="detail-text"> This is one of my favorite projects! Together with 'Jens Van Steen' we made our own version of the classic "Hotline Miami" game. We made a map that was our own school building and added our teachers as characters. In this project we had to teach ourself how the framework works and fix the bugs. After the switch we added a leaderboard using PHP to the other groups game. The teamwork was very nice and we where on the same page all the time. </p>
