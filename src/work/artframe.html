        <h3 class="detail-title">Brief</h3>
        <p class="detail-text"> The museum "Boijmans van Beuningen" in Rotterdam has to close for 3 years due construction working and renovating. We had to collaborate with a school of Rotterdam and come up with some cool digital ideas so the visitors still could see what the museum has to offer. Also they wanted to get more attention of the younger generation using a digital way of showing the art pieces.</p>
        <h3 class="detail-title">Concept</h3>
        <p class="detail-text">
        Our concept was to bring the art to the streets of Rotterdam instead of showing it in one place. There was an app to
        scan "frames" in the city. If you can a frame, the art work comes to life. Then you could ask information using an
        assistant. When the user liked it he could start a tour through the whole city.</p>

        <h3 class="detail-title">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="detail-text"> 
          It is impressive how much work you can do as a team and the combination of different mindsets. Altough this was not always easy because you have to make sure everyone is on the same page or give honest feedback. I'm very happy with our result. We used some AR technology we haven't seen in our classes so it was experimental </p>
